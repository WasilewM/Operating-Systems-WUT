# Operating-Systems-WUT  
Projects done during Operating system course at FEIT at WUT.  
  
Task 1 - add procedure in Minix - add system procedure that will return given process id index from process  table of the system  
Task 3 - Semaphores (processes synchronization I) - create 2 producents (p1 and p2) and 3 consumers thread. Each consumer matched  
to one buffer (queue). Producer P1 is matched to buffer A and B, producer P2 is matched to buffer B and C. Using semaphores  
provide soluttion that will be free data races.  
Task 4 - Monitors (processes synchronization II) - refactor task 3 to use monitors for processes synchronization.  
Task 5 - Memory management in Minix (draft) - add procedures and modify alloc.c in order to allow for worst fit memory hole choosing
